# Plant Stand Project v5

Welcome prospective employers! This project is purely for my own personal interest and wasn't really designed to share, but I decided to make the repo public to ~hopefully~ increase my odds of getting an interview.

---

I've been experimenting with growing plants in enclosed structures since 2015--past versions of my stand have been a lot smaller, and had features this stand does not have like ventilation and fully automated hydroponics.

The focus of this stand is to have fine grained control over the lights, from anywhere in the world. Oh, and also making it way bigger and more powerful (specs: 15 cubit feet, 400watts).

---
The JavaScript code in this repo is for an app to control the stand (progressive web app downloadable to any device). C++ code is what I used to program ESP-32 microcontrollers attached to each individual grow light.

## Features
- On/off control for each light
- Permanent time range setting
- Temporary cycle setting
- All lights on/off toggle
- Viewing mode toggle

## Basic Usage of the App to Control Lights in My Plant Stand
